            <p class="alexText alexBio">Hi! I’m a student at Boise State University (BSU) studying Games, Interactive Media, and Mobile Technology (which is basically video game design and related subjects), and Computer Science. And I am also a trained Cosmetologist.
            I’ve lived in America for 18 years (15 of which were spent in Arizona), although I was born in Weston-super-Mare, England. I am a huge geek who loves Star Wars, Doctor Who, reading, and coffee.

            <p class="alexText alexTextLeft">This gif is from "Welcome to the JIMMgle," a project I worked on with a team of other students including a fellow member of the JAAM team, Jasmine Young. The player controls a tiger as it makes its way through various challenges to get to the center of the jungle.

            <p class="alexText alexTextRight">This is a screenshot of a quick game loop I made for one of the two-week challenges for the Dev Club at BSU. You start in the ruins of a ancient building, and have to find all the coins to pay the spirit in the ruins for your freedom. Within the ruins there's three doors, one takes you into the past, one into the future, and the other just leads you farther into the ruins.

            <p class="alexText alexTextLeft">This is a game trailer for a game that I made in the first semester of GIMM. I was given the core structure of the game (trigonometry, array collection and removal, and enemy spawning), and I added in my own code, artwork, and story to reinvent the game.
