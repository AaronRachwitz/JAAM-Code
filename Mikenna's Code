	<h2 class="white-text"> Who is she?</h2>
	<p class="white-text">Like many she’s been gaming since a young age and has loved most moments of it. Due to this love, she’s been knowing what she’s wanted to do since middle school. She has plenty of art experience having done it all through high school. Along with that, she has a little experience within Blender, Unity and some experience with a few programming languages.</p>
